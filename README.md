# FunBox Experiments

Those are some experiments I'm doing with my curstom build of [FunBox](https://github.com/GuitarML/FunBox) guitar pedal.

## Building

This project uses `nix-shell` to create a development environment, so it's necessary. Assuming it's available, building it is as simple as running:

```shell
nix-shell --run "make"
```

This will build all the experiments.
